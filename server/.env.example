# Session secret for express-session (CRITICAL: use a strong, random string in production)
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
# SECURITY: Rotate this secret regularly in production

# ✓ Regularly rotate your SESSION_SECRET (at least monthly)
# ✓ Use environment-specific secrets for different deployments
# ✓ Monitor for unauthorized file access attempts
