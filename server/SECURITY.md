# Security Hardening Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application and provides guidelines for secure deployment.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. HTTP Security Headers (Helmet)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS in production
- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: Controls DNS prefetching behavior

### 2. Rate Limiting (express-rate-limit)
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **File Upload**: 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Protection**: Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse

### 3. File Upload Security
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters from filenames
- **MIME Type Verification**: Verifies file content matches declared MIME type
- **File Size Limits**: 
  - PDF files: 10 MB maximum
  - MP4 videos: 100 MB maximum
- **Storage Location**: Files stored outside web root (`uploads-secure/`)
- **Access Control**: Files served through authenticated endpoints only

### 4. Session Security
- **Secure Cookies**: Enabled in production (HTTPS required)
- **HttpOnly**: Prevents client-side access to session cookies
- **SameSite**: Set to 'strict' to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Session Secret**: Must be rotated regularly

### 5. CORS Protection
- **Origin Restriction**: Only configured client URLs allowed
- **Credentials**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Production Environment
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Generate strong `SESSION_SECRET` (64+ characters)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers
- [ ] Set up firewall rules
- [ ] Enable database authentication and encryption
- [ ] Configure log monitoring and alerting

### Session Secret Rotation
```bash
# Generate new session secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

### File Storage Security
- Files are stored in `uploads-secure/` directory outside web root
- Access controlled through `/api/files/:filename` endpoint
- Authentication required for file access
- MIME type verification prevents malicious file uploads

### Directory Structure
```
project/
├── server/
│   └── uploads-secure/     # Secure file storage (outside web root)
├── uploads-secure/         # Alternative location (current implementation)
└── client/
    └── public/            # Static assets only (no user uploads)
```

## Security Headers Configuration

### Helmet Configuration
```javascript
helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "blob:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'"],
    },
  },
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: false
})
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review access logs for suspicious activity
2. **Monthly**: Rotate session secrets
3. **Quarterly**: Update dependencies and security patches
4. **Semi-annually**: Security audit and penetration testing

### Log Monitoring
Monitor for:
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Rate limit violations
- MIME type verification failures
- Unauthorized file access attempts

## Additional Recommendations

### Infrastructure Security
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement DDoS protection
- Set up intrusion detection systems
- Regular security scans and vulnerability assessments

### Database Security
- Enable database authentication
- Use encrypted connections
- Regular backup verification
- Implement proper access controls

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper certificate management
- Configure secure communication between services
- VPN access for administrative tasks

## Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
