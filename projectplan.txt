**Project Title:** Bridging Rural Education Gaps with a Unified Digital Platform

---

## Problem Statement

### Scope Clarification
While the broader challenge includes limited internet connectivity, this project focuses on delivering software-based solutions that are effective within the constraints of existing infrastructure. Network optimization tools such as bandwidth diagnostics and connectivity enhancements are not included in the current implementation scope but may be considered for future development or integration with third-party solutions.

Rural regions in India face significant educational challenges due to inadequate infrastructure, limited technological access, and a shortage of qualified teaching staff. Although platforms like Vidyanjali facilitate collaboration between schools and external contributors, they often exclude direct student engagement. This project proposes a unified digital platform that incorporates students, schools, volunteers, and NGOs to enable virtual learning, resource management, infrastructure support, and student performance tracking.

## Objectives
1. Introduce students as active platform users
2. Provide school administrators with tools to manage students, requests, and content
3. Enable volunteers and NGOs to fulfill infrastructure and educational support requests
4. Deliver virtual classes, recorded content, assessments, and analytics for student progress

---

## User Roles
### 1. School Administrator
- Manages student data (via manual input or CSV upload)
- Creates and tracks requests (infrastructure, educational content, virtual teaching)
- Reviews and approves applications from volunteers or NGOs
- Monitors student engagement and performance

### 2. Student
- Participates in virtual and recorded classes
- Accesses learning materials and completes assessments
- Reviews academic progress and feedback

### 3. Volunteer
- Views and responds to school requests
- Delivers virtual lessons or uploads instructional materials

### 4. Organization/NGO
- Contributes by fulfilling infrastructure or material requests
- Tracks historical contributions and fulfillment status

## Student Login System
- **Account Creation:** Managed by the school administrator (bulk or individual entry)
- **Username Format:** `SCHOOLCODE_ROLLNO` (e.g., S12345_09)
- **Password:** Default value based on date of birth or system-generated string
- **Access Scope:** Students gain access to their assigned classes, materials, and assessments after authentication

---

## Request Categories
### 1. Infrastructure
Requests for items such as desks, smart boards, sanitation facilities, and internet devices. These can be fulfilled by NGOs or independent volunteers.

### 2. Virtual Instruction
Requests for subject-specific sessions (e.g., “Grade 6 - Water Cycle”) where volunteers either conduct live classes or provide pre-recorded lessons.

### 3. Educational Materials
Requests for supporting materials such as worksheets, interactive modules, and multimedia learning resources tailored to specific grades and subjects.

## Entity Relationships
- **School → Students:** One-to-many
- **School → Requests:** One-to-many
- **Volunteer ↔ Requests:** Many-to-many (with status tracking for applications)
- **Students ↔ Content:** Many-to-many (based on assignments and grades)

---

## Functional Flow Example
1. School administrator uploads a batch of student records
2. A request is created for “Grade 6 Mathematics: Recorded Lessons”
3. A volunteer applies and submits three lesson videos
4. The administrator assigns these materials to the relevant student group
5. Students log in to view content and complete associated assessments
6. Performance data is reviewed via analytics dashboards

## Conclusion
This project builds upon the foundational principles of platforms like Vidyanjali, with an enhanced focus on student engagement, digital content delivery, and learning analytics. By ensuring structured involvement from schools, volunteers, and organizations, the platform provides a scalable and impactful model for improving educational outcomes in rural India.

The primary goal is to deliver an accessible and sustainable education support system that strengthens the connection between infrastructure, pedagogy, and student success.
